            <h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
            <p>
                We're a group of Book lovers who also happen to work together at QUICK BEEF STEAKHOUSE.
                What started as casual Book chats during breaks quickly turned into something more — a shared passion
                for the written word. From that bond, qbfBooks was born. Our goal is simple: to give great Books a
                second life and connect them with readers who truly appreciate them.

            <h3>OUR MISSION</h3>
            <p>
                We believe every Book deserves more than one reader. At qbfBooks, our mission is to preserve stories,
                ideas, and knowledge by offering carefully selected pre-owned Books at affordable prices.
                We aim to make reading accessible, sustainable, and full of discovery — one Book at a time.
            </p>

            <h3>LOOKING AHEAD</h3>
            <p>
                We're just getting started. In the near future, we plan to expand our catalog, introduce themed
                collections, and build a stronger reading community around qbfBooks. Whether you're here for rare finds,
                academic titles, or just your next cozy weekend read — we're here for you.
