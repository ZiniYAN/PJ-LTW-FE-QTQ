        <h1>Return, Exchange & Refund Policy</h1>

        <p>
            We want you to feel confident when buying from us. If the book you receive is not as described —
            such as having unexpected damage, missing pages, or is a different edition —
            you’re eligible for a <strong>free return, exchange, or full refund within 30 days</strong>
            of receiving your order.
        </p>

        <h2>Return Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You can request a return if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The book’s condition doesn’t match the description or photos</li>
            <li>You received the wrong title, edition, or author</li>
            <li>The book arrived damaged or has missing/torn pages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No photos or proof are required — we trust our customers.</p>

        <h2>Exchange Option</h2>
        <p>
            If you’d prefer an <strong>exchange instead of a refund</strong>, we’ll be happy to send you a replacement copy (if available).
            Simply let us know your preference when you contact us.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the requested replacement is out of stock, we’ll offer a refund or store credit based on your choice.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Start a Return or Exchange</h2>
        <p>
            Just email us at <a href="mailto:contact@qbfbooks.com">contact@qbfbooks.com</a> within 30 days of delivery.
            We’ll send you a <strong>free prepaid return label</strong> and instructions for returning the book.
        </p>
        <p>
            You don’t need the original packaging, but please repack it securely.
        </p>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>
            Once we receive your return, we’ll process your refund to your original payment method
            within <strong>3–5 business days</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>Exceptions</h2>
        <p>We cannot accept returns or exchanges for:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Requests made after 30 days from delivery</li>
        </ul>
